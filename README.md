Upper Humber River Watershed (UHRW) in Western Newfoundland, which is part of the Atlantic boreal region of North America. This area, specifically located in Western Newfoundland, Canada, spans approximately 2,800 square kilometers.

LSTM model has been applied to the watershed and it exhibited superior performance in predicting streamflow.

The objectives of this study are:

1.	Evaluate the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in streamflow forecasting within the Humber River basin in Newfoundland, Canada.
2.	Assess the ability of LSTM models to capture the complex dynamics of streamflow in the study region.
3.	Analyze the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2) metrics to quantify the performance of LSTM models in streamflow forecasting.
