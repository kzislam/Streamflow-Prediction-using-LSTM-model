Abstract
Streamflow plays a vital role in water resource management and environmental impact assessment. 
This study is a novel application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network, 
for real-time streamflow prediction in the Upper Humber River Watershed in western Newfoundland. 
It also compares the performance of the LSTM model with the physically based SWAT model. 
The LSTM model was optimized by tuning hyperparameters and adjusting the look-back period (window size) to balance 
capturing historical data and ensuring prediction stability. Using single input variables such as daily average 
temperature or precipitation, the LSTM achieved a high Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.95. In comparison, 
the results show that the LSTM model delivers a more competitive performance, achieving a NSE of 0.95 versus SWAT’s 0.77, 
and a percent bias (PBIAS) of 0.62 compared to SWAT’s 8.26. Unlike SWAT, the LSTM model does not overestimate high flows 
and excels in predicting low flows. Additionally, the LSTM successfully predicted daily streamflow using real-time data. 
Despite challenges in interpretability and generalizability, the LSTM model demonstrated strong performance, particularly 
during extreme events, making it a valuable tool for streamflow prediction in cold climates where accurate forecasts are 
crucial for effective water management. Moreover, hybrid models that merge LSTM’s strength in recognizing temporal patterns 
with SWAT’s detailed watershed simulations could provide a more comprehensive solution for hydrological forecasting. 
This study highlights the potential of the LSTM model's deep learning techniques, using minimal features, to improve water 
resource management by effectively capturing high and low flow events, seasonality, and integrating real-time data.
